(14.1) \\n• Adolescents (ages 13-17): Efficacy was established in one 6-\\nweek trial in patients with schizophrenia (14.1). The increased \\npotential (in adolescents compared with adults) for weight \\ngain and dyslipidemia  may lead clinicians to consider \\nprescribing other drugs first in adolescents. (1.1) \\n• Acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder. \\n(1.2) \\n• Adults: Efficacy was established in three clinical trials in patients with manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder: \\ntwo 3- to 4-week trials and one maintenance trial. (14.2) \\n• Adolescents (ages 13-17): Efficacy was established in one 3-week trial in patients with manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (14.2). The increased potential (in \\nadolescents compared with adults ) for weight gain and \\ndyslipidemia  may lead clinicians to consider prescribing other \\ndrugs first in adolescents. (1.2) \\n• Medication therapy for pediatric patients with schizophrenia or \\nbipolar I disorder should be undertaken only after a thorough \\ndiagnostic evaluation and with careful consideration of the \\npotential risks. (1.3) \\n• Adjunct to valproate or lithium in the treatment of manic or mixed \\nepisodes associated with bipolar I disorder.

Analyses of seventeen placebo -controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking \\natypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug -treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk \\nof death in placebo -treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10- week controlled trial, the rate of death in\\ndrug- treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the\\ncauses of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden \\ndeath) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar t o atypical \\nantipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to \\nwhich the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as\\nopposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. ZYPREXA (olanzapine) is not approved for the \\ntreatment of patients with dementia -related psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific \\nPopulations (8.5), and Patient Counseling Information (17)]. \\nWhen using ZYPREXA and fluoxetine in combination, also refer to the Boxed Warning section of the \\npackage insert for Symbyax. \\n1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE \\n1.1 Schizophrenia \\nOral ZYPREXA is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia. Efficacy was established in three clinical trials in \\nadult patients with schizophrenia: two 6- week trials and one maintenance trial. In adolescent patients with schizophrenia \\n(ages 13 -17), efficacy was established in one 6- week trial [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . \\nWhen deciding among the alternative treatments available for adolescents, clinicians should consider the \\nincreased potential (in adolescents as compared with adults) for weight gain and dyslipidemia . Clinicians should consider \\nthe potential long- term risks when prescribing to adolescents, and in many cases this may lead them to consider \\nprescribing other drugs first in adolescents [see Warnings and Precautions (5. 5)]. \\n1.2 Bipolar I Disorder (Manic or Mixed Episodes)\\nMonotherapy — Oral ZYPREXA is indicated for the acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with \\nbipolar I disorder and maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder. Efficacy was established in three clinical trials in adult \\npatients with manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder: two 3- to 4-week trials and one monotherapy maintenance \\ntrial. In adolescent patients with manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (ages 13 -17), efficacy was \\nestablished in one 3- week trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] . \\nWhen deciding among the alternative treatments available for adolescents , clinicians should consider the \\nincreased potential (in adolescents as compared with adults) for weight gain and dyslipidemia . Clinicians should consider \\nthe potential long- term risks when prescribing to adolescents, and in many cases this may lead them to consider \\nprescribing other drugs first in adolescents [see Warnings and Precautions (5. 5)]. \\nAdjunctive Therapy to Lithium or Valproate — Oral ZYPREXA is indicated for the treatment of manic or mixed \\nepisodes associated with bipolar I disorder as an adjunct to lithium or valproate. Efficacy was established in two 6- week \\nclinical trials in adults. The effectiveness of adjunctive therapy for longer -term use has not been systematically evaluated \\nin controlled trials [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] . \\n1.3 Special Considerations in Treating Pediatric Schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder\\nPediatric schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder are serious mental disorders ; however, diagnosis can be \\nchallenging. For pediatric schizophrenia, symptom profiles can be variable, and for bipolar I disorder, pediatric patients \\nmay have variable patterns of periodicity of manic or mixed symptoms. It is recommended that medication therapy for \\npediatric schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder be initiated only after a thorough diagnostic evaluation has been performed \\nand careful consideration given to the risks associated with medication treatment. Medication treatment for both pediatric \\nschizophrenia and bipolar I disorder should be part of a total treatment program that often includes psychological, \\neducational and social interventions. \\n1.4 ZYPREXA IntraMuscular: Agitation Associated with Schizophrenia and Bipolar I Mania\\nZYPREXA IntraMuscular is indicated for the treatment of acute agitation associated with schizophrenia and \\nbipolar I mania. \\nEfficacy was demonstrated in 3 short -term (24 hours of IM treatment) placebo -controlled trials in agitated adult \\ninpatients with: schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) [see Clinical Studies (14.3)] . \\n“Psychomotor agitation” is defined in DSM -IV as “excessive motor activity associated with a feeling of inner \\ntension.” Patients experiencing agitation often manifest behaviors that interfere with their diagnosis and care, e.g., \\nthreatening behaviors, escalating or urgently distressing behavior, or self -exhausting behavior, leading clinicians to the \\nuse of intramuscular antipsychotic medications to achieve immediate control of the agitation. \\nReference ID: 5516073 \\n  \\n         \\n       \\n          \\n     \\n           \\n \\n        \\n        \\n          \\n       \\n         \\n          \\n    \\n  \\n \\n      \\n            \\n              \\n         \\n      \\n           \\n         \\n               \\n       \\n       \\n        \\n         \\n       \\n    \\n          \\n       \\n         \\n           \\n  \\n \\n \\n      \\n          \\n        \\n         \\n   \\n          \\n  \\n        \\n        \\n           \\n         \\n     \\n    \\n \\n       \\n            \\n         \\n       \\n              \\n             \\n          \\n             \\n         \\n        5 \\n1.5 ZYPREXA and Fluoxetine in Combination: Depressive Episodes Associated with Bipolar I Disorder\\nOral ZYPREXA and fluoxetine in combination is indicated for the treatment of depressive episodes associated with \\nbipolar I disorder, based on clinical studies . When using ZYPREXA and fluoxetine in combination, refer to the Clinical \\nStudies section of the package insert for Symbyax . \\nZYPREXA monotherapy is not indicated for the treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar I \\ndisorder . \\n1.6 ZYPREXA and Fluoxetine in Combination: Treatment Resistant Depression\\nOral ZYPREXA and fluoxetine in combination is indicated for the treatment of treatment resistant depression \\n(major depressive disorder in patients who do not respond to 2 separate trials of different antidepressants of adequate \\ndose and duration in the current episode), based on clinical studies in adult patients. When using ZYPREXA and \\nfluoxetine in combination, refer to the Clinical Studies section of the package insert for Symbyax. \\nZYPREXA monotherapy is not indicated for the treatment of treatment resistant depression. \\n2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \\n2.1 Schizophrenia \\nAdults \\nDose Selection — Oral olanzapine should be administered on a once -a-day schedule without regard to meals, \\ngenerally beginning with 5 to 10 mg initially, with a target dose of 10 mg/day within several days. Further dosage \\nadjustments, if indicated, should generally occur at intervals of not less than 1 week, since steady state for olanzapine would not be achieved for approximately 1 week in the typical patient. When dosage adjustments are necessary, dose increments/decrements of 5 mg QD are recommended. \\nEfficacy in schizophrenia was demonstrated in a dose range of 10 to 15 mg/day in clinical trials. However, doses \\nabove 10 mg/day were not demonstrated to be more efficacious than the 10 mg/day dose. An increase to a dose greater \\nthan the target dose of 10 mg/day (i.e., to a dose of 15 mg/day or greater) is recommended only after clinical assessment. \\nOlanzapine is not indicated for use in doses above 20 mg/day. \\nDosing in Special Populations — The recommended starting dose is 5 mg in patients who are debilitated, who \\nhave a predisposition to hypotensive reactions, who otherwise exhibit a combination of factors that may result in slower \\nmetabolism of olanzapine (e.g., nonsmoking female patients ≥65 years of age), or who may be more \\npharmacodynamically sensitive to olanzapine [see Warnings and Precautions (5. 14), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical \\nPharmacology (12.3)] . When indicated, dose escalation should be performed with caution in these patients. \\nMaintenance Treatment — The effectiveness of oral olanzapine, 10 mg/day to 20 mg/day, in maintaining treatment \\nresponse in schizophrenic patients who had been stable on ZYPREXA for approximately 8 weeks and were then followed for relapse has been demonstrated in a placebo -controlled trial [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . The healthcare provider who \\nelects to use ZYPREXA for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long- term usefulness of the drug for the \\nindividual patient . \\nAdolescents \\nDose Selection — Oral olanzapine should be administered on a once -a-day schedule without regard to meals with \\na recommended starting dose of 2.5 or 5 mg, with a target dose of 10 mg/day. Efficacy in adolescents with schizophrenia \\nwas demonstrated based on a flexible dose range of 2.5 to 20 mg/day in clinical trials, with a mean modal dose of \\n12.5 mg/day (mean dose of 11.1 mg/day). When dosage adjustments are necessary, dose increments/decrements of 2.5 \\nor 5 mg are recommended. \\nThe safety and effectiveness of doses above 20 mg/day have not been evaluated in clinical trials [see Clinical \\nStudies (14.1)] . \\nMaintenance Treatment — The efficacy of ZYPREXA for the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in the \\nadolescent population has not been systematically evaluated; however , maintenance efficacy can be extrapolated from \\nadult data along with comparisons of olanzapine pharmacokinetic parameters in adult and adolescent patients. Thus, it is \\ngenerally recommended that responding patients be continued beyond the acute response, but at the lowest dose needed \\nto maintain remission. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment. \\n2.2 Bipolar I Disorder (Manic or Mixed Episodes) \\nAdults \\nDose Selection for Monotherapy — Oral olanzapine should be administered on a once -a-day schedule without \\nregard to meals, generally beginning with 10 or 15 mg. Dosage adjustments, if indicated, should generally occur at \\nintervals of not less than 24 hours, reflecting the procedures in the placebo -controlled trials.

The healthcare provider who elects to use ZYPREXA for extended periods \\nshould periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient. \\nReference ID: 5516073 \\n  \\n         \\n      \\n              \\n          \\n \\n \\n     \\n            \\n          \\n         \\n     \\n          \\n  \\n          \\n         \\n           \\n      \\n      \\n       \\n           \\n         \\n      \\n       \\n           \\n        \\n             \\n          \\n             \\n           \\n               \\n           \\n         \\n         \\n          \\n        \\n     \\n             \\n    \\n         \\n           \\n       \\n        \\n         \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n           \\n          \\n       \\n       \\n         \\n   \\n \\n     \\n      \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n       \\n     6 \\nDose Selection for Adjunctive Treatment — When administered as adjunctive treatment to lithium or valproate, oral \\nolanzapine dosing should generally begin with 10 mg once -a-day without regard to meals. \\nAntimanic efficacy was demonstrated in a dose range of 5 mg to 20 mg/day in clinical trials [see Clinical Studies \\n(14.2)] . The safety of doses above 20 mg/day has not been evaluated in clinical trials. \\nAdolescents \\nDose Selection — Oral olanzapine should be administered on a once -a-day schedule without regard to meals with \\na recommended starting dose of 2.5 or 5 mg, with a target dose of 10 mg/day. Efficacy in adolescents with bipolar I \\ndisorder (manic or mixed episodes) was demonstrated based on a flexible dose range of 2.5 to 20 mg/day in clinical trials, \\nwith a mean modal dose of 10.7 mg/day (mean dose of 8.9 mg/day).

Thus, it is generally recommended that responding patients be continued beyond the acute response, but at the lowest dose needed to \\nmaintain remission. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment. \\n2.3 Administration of ZYPREXA ZYDIS (olanzapine orally disintegrating tablets)\\nAfter opening sachet, peel back foil on blister. Do not push tablet through foil. Immediately upon opening the \\nblister, using dry hands, remove tablet and place entire ZYPREXA ZYDIS in the mouth. Tablet disintegration occurs rapidly in saliva so it can be easily swallowed with or without liquid. \\n2.4 ZYPREXA IntraMuscular: Agitation Associated with Schizophrenia and Bipolar I Mania \\nDose Selection for Agitated Adult Patients with Schizophrenia and Bipolar I Mania — The efficacy of intramuscular \\nolanzapine for injection in controlling agitation in these disorders was demonstrated in a dose range of 2.5 mg to 10 mg. \\nThe recommended dose in these patients is 10 mg. A lower dose of 5 or 7.5 mg may be considered when c linical factors \\nwarrant [see Clinical Studies (14. 3)]. If agitation warranting additional intramuscular doses persists following the initial \\ndose, subsequent doses up to 10 mg may be given. However, the efficacy of repeated doses of intramuscular olanzapine \\nfor injection in agitated patients has not been systematically evaluated in controlled clinical trials. Also, the safety of t otal \\ndaily doses greater than 30 mg, or 10 mg injections given more frequently than 2 hours after the initial dose, and 4 hours after the second dose have not been evaluated in clinical trials. Maximal dosing of intramuscular olanzapine (e.g., 3 doses \\nof 10 mg administered 2 -4 hours apart) may be associated with a substantial occurrence of significant orthostatic \\nhypotension [see Wa rnings and Precautions (5. 7)]. Thus, it is recommended that patients requiring subsequent \\nintramuscular injections be assessed for orthostatic hypotension prior to the administration of any subsequent doses of \\nintramuscular olanzapine for injection. The administration of an additional dose to a patient with a clinically significant \\npostural change in systolic blood pressure is not recommended. \\nIf ongoing olanzapine therapy is clinically indicated, oral olanzapine may be initiated in a range of 5- 20 mg/day as \\nsoon as clinically appropriate [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)] . \\nIntramuscular Dosing in Special Populations — A dose of 5 mg/injection should be considered for geriatric patients \\nor when other clinical factors warrant. A lower dose of 2.5 mg/injection should be considered for patients who otherwise \\nmight be debilitated, be predisposed to hypotensive reactions, or be more pharmacodynamically sensitive to olanzapine \\n[see Warnings and Precautions (5. 14), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . \\nAdministration of ZYPREXA IntraMuscular — ZYPREXA IntraMuscular is intended for intramuscular use only. Do \\nnot administer intravenously or subcutaneously. Inject slowly, deep into the muscle mass. \\nParenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to \\nadministration, whenever solution and container permit. \\nDirections for Preparation of ZYPREXA IntraMuscular with Sterile Water for Injection — Dissolve the contents of \\nthe vial using 2.1 mL of Sterile Water for Injection to provide a solution containing approximately 5 mg/mL of olanzapine. \\nThe resulting solution should appear clear and yellow. ZYPREXA IntraMuscular reconstituted with Sterile Water for \\nInjection should be used immediately (within 1 hour) after reconstitution.

ZYPREXA is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia -related \\npsychosis [see Box ed Warning, Use in Specific Populations (8.5) , and Patient Counseling Information (17)] . \\nIn placebo- controlled clinical trials of elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis, the incidence of death in \\nolanzapine- treated patients was significantly greater than placebo-treated patients (3.5% vs 1.5%, respectively). \\nCerebrovascular Adverse Events (CVAE), Including Stroke — Cerebrovascular adverse events (e.g., stroke, \\ntransient ischemic attack), including fatalities, were reported in patients in trials of olanzapine in elderly patients with \\ndementia -related psychosis. In placebo -controlled trials, there was a significantly higher incidence of cerebrovascular \\nadverse events in patients treated with olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo. Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementi a-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning and Patient Counseling Information \\n(17)]. \\nReference ID: 5516073 \\n  \\n  \\n         \\n          \\n         \\n \\n     \\n            \\n         \\n         \\n        \\n    \\n           \\n          \\n          \\n           \\n  \\n           \\n            \\n            \\n      \\n           \\n         \\n    \\n      \\n      \\n           \\n           \\n          \\n   \\n       \\n        \\n     \\n \\n    \\n     \\n        \\n       \\n     \\n         \\n       \\n     \\n       \\n       \\n \\n        \\n      \\n       \\n        \\n        \\n       \\n       \\n     \\n      \\n          \\n          \\n  \\n        \\n      \\n  9 \\n5.2 Suicide \\nThe possibility of a suicide attempt is inherent in schizophrenia and in bipolar I disorder, and close supervision of \\nhigh- risk patients should accompany drug therapy. Prescriptions for olanzapine should be written for the smallest quantity \\nof tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. \\n5.3 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)\\nA potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been \\nreported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including olanzapine. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood \\npressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatinine \\nphosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. \\nThe diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to \\nexclude cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, \\netc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in \\nthe differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous \\nsystem pathology. \\nThe management of NMS should include: 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not \\nessential to concurrent therapy; 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and 3) treatment of any \\nconcomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for NMS. \\nIf a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug \\ntherapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported [see Patient Counseling Information (17)] . \\n5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)\\nDrug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported with olanzapine exposure. \\nDRESS may present with a cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, fever, and/or \\nlymphadenopathy with systemic complications such as hepatitis, nephritis, pneumonitis, myocarditis , and/or pericarditis. \\nDRESS is sometimes fatal. Discontinue olanzapine if DRESS is suspected [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. \\n5.5 Metabolic Changes\\nAtypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes including hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, \\nand weight gain. Metabolic changes may be associated with increased cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. Olanzapine’s specific metabolic profile is presented below. \\nHyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus\\nHealthcare provider s should consider the risks and benefits when prescribing olanzapine to patients with an \\nestablished diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, or having borderline increased blood glucose level (fasting 100 -126 mg/dL, \\nnonfasting 140- 200 mg/dL). Patients taking olanzapine should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. \\nPatients starting treatment with olanzapine should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and \\nperiodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of \\nhyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, \\nhyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti -diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug [see Patient Counseling Information \\n(17)]. \\nHyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has \\nbeen reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including olanzapine. Assessment of the relationship \\nbetween atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased \\nbackground risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment -emergent hyperglycemia- related \\nadverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. While relative risk estimates are inconsistent, the \\nassociation between atypical antipsychotics and increases in glucose levels appears to fall on a continuum and \\nolanzapine appears to have a greater association than some other atypical antipsychotics. \\nMean increases in blood glucose have been observed in patients treated (median exposure of 9.2 months) with \\nolanzapine in phase 1 of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE). The mean increase of serum glucose (fasting and nonfasting samples) from baseline to the average of the 2 highest serum concentrations was \\n15.0 mg/dL. \\nIn a study of healthy volunteers, subjects who received olanzapine (N=22) for 3 weeks had a mean increase \\ncompared to baseline in fasting blood glucose of 2.3 mg/dL. Placebo- treated subjects (N=19) had a mean increase in \\nfasting blood glucose compared to baseline of 0.34 mg/dL. \\nReference ID: 5516073 \\n  \\n        \\n        \\n      \\n      \\n        \\n         \\n       \\n    \\n       \\n       \\n        \\n \\n          \\n     \\n  \\n \\n \\n    \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n         \\n       \\n       \\n       \\n   \\n \\n        \\n        \\n  \\n      \\n             \\n           \\n     \\n           \\n         \\n  \\n \\n          \\n     \\n   \\n \\n \\n    \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n         \\n        \\n       \\n       \\n   \\n \\n \\n     \\n        \\n \\n        \\n      \\n       \\n          \\n          \\n              \\n        \\n     \\n         \\n      \\n    10 \\nOlanzapine Monotherapy in Adults — In an analysis of 5 placebo- controlled adult olanzapine monotherapy studies \\nwith a median treatment duration of approximately 3 weeks, olanzapine was associated with a greater mean change in \\nfasting glucose levels compared to placebo (2.76 mg/dL versus 0.17 mg/dL). The difference in mean changes between \\nolanzapine and placebo was greater in patients with evidence of glucose dysregulation at baseline (patients diagnosed \\nwith diabetes mellitus or related adverse reactions , patients treated with anti -diabetic agents, patients with a baseline \\nrandom glucose level ≥200 mg/dL, and/or a baseline fasting glucose level ≥126 mg/dL).

Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive \\ndyskinesia is unknown. \\nThe risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase \\nas the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. \\nHowever, the synd rome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses \\nor may even arise after discontinuation of treatment . \\nTardive dyskinesia may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic \\ntreatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby \\nmay possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long -term course of the \\nsyndrome is unknown. \\nReference ID: 5516073 \\n  \\n      \\n          \\n              \\n          \\n        \\n   \\n        \\n        \\n           \\n    \\n  \\n     \\n         \\n   \\n         \\n          \\n        \\n        \\n  \\n       \\n         \\n       \\n          \\n      \\n        \\n       \\n         \\n            \\n            \\n       \\n           \\n           \\n   \\n     \\n          \\n    \\n         \\n  \\n        \\n           \\n        \\n  \\n  \\n          \\n             \\n          \\n   \\n    \\n        \\n       \\n         \\n          \\n        \\n              \\n   \\n            \\n        \\n       14 \\nGiven these considerations, olanzapine should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the \\noccurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients (1) who suffer \\nfrom a chronic illness that is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but \\npotentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the \\nsmallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically. \\nIf signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on olanzapine, drug discontinuation should be \\nconsidered. However, some patients may require treatment with olanzapine despite the presence of the syndrome. \\nFor specific information about the warnings of lithium or valproate, refer to the Warnings section of the package \\ninserts for these other products. \\n5.7 Orthostatic Hypotension\\nOlanzapine may induce orthostatic hypotension associated with dizziness, tachycardia, bradycardia and, in some \\npatients, syncope, especially during the initial dose-titration period, probably reflecting its α\\n1-adrenergic antagonistic \\nproperties [see Patient Counseling Information (17)] . \\nFrom an analysis of the vital sign data in an integrated database of 41 completed clinical studies in adult patients \\ntreated with oral olanzapine, orthostatic hypotension was recorded in ≥20% (1277/6030) of patients. \\nFor oral olanzapine therapy, the risk of orthostatic hypotension and syncope may be minimized by initiating \\ntherapy with 5 mg QD [see Dosage and Administration (2)] . A more gradual titration to the target dose should be \\nconsidered if hypotension occurs. \\nHypotension, bradycardia with or without hypotension, tachycardia, and syncope were also reported during the \\nclinical trials with intramuscular olanzapine for injection. In an open- label cli nical pharmacology study in nonagitated \\npatients with schizophrenia in which the safety and tolerability of intramuscular olanzapine were evaluated under a \\nmaximal dosing regimen (three 10 mg doses administered 4 hours apart), approximately one -third of these patients \\nexperienced a significant orthostatic decrease in systolic blood pressure (i.e., decrease ≥30 mmHg) [see Dosage and \\nAdministration (2. 4)]. Syncope was reported in 0.6% (15/2500) of olanzapine- treated patients in phase 2-3 oral olanzapine \\nstudies and in 0.3% (2/722) of olanzapine- treated patients with agitation in the intramuscular olanzapine for injection \\nstudies. Three normal volunteers in phase 1 studies with intramuscular olanzapine experienced hypotension, bradycardia, \\nand sinus pauses of up to 6 seconds that spontaneously resolved (in 2 cases the reactions occurred on intramuscular \\nolanzapine, and in 1 case, on oral olanzapine). The risk for this sequence of hypotension, bradycardia, and sinus pause \\nmay be greater in nonpsychiatric patients compared to psychiatric patients who are possibly more adapted to certain effects of psychotropic drugs . For intramuscular olanzapine for injection therapy, patients should remain recumbent if \\ndrowsy or dizzy after injection until examination has indicated that they are not experiencing postural hypotension, bradycardia, and/or hypoventilation. \\nOlanzapine should be used with particular caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of \\nmyocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications) where the occurrence of syncope, or hypotension and/or bradycardia might put the patient at increased \\nmedical risk. \\nCaution is necessary in patients who receive treatment with other drugs having effects that can induce \\nhypotension, bradycardia, respiratory or central nervous system depression [see Drug Interactions (7)] . Concomitant \\nadministration of intramuscular olanzapine and parenteral benzodiazepine is not recommended due to the potential for \\nexcessive sedation and cardiorespiratory depression. \\n5.8 Falls \\nZYPREXA may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls \\nand, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate \\nthese effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-\\nterm antipsychotic therapy. \\n5.9 Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis\\nClass Effect — In clinical trial and/or postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia have been \\nreported temporally related to antipsychotic agents, including ZYPREXA. Agranulocytosis has also been reported. \\nPossible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre -existing low white blood cell count ( WBC) and history \\nof drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia . Patients with a history of a clinicall y sign ificant low WBC or drug induced \\nleukopenia/neutropenia should ha ve the ir complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of \\ntherapy and disco ntinuation of ZYPREXA should be cons idered at the first sign of a clinically signif icant decline in WBC in \\nthe absen ce of other causative factors. \\nPatients with clinically significant neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of \\ninfection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil \\ncount <1000/mm\\n3) should discontinue ZYPREXA and have their WBC followed until recovery. \\nReference ID: 5516073 \\n \\n  \\n      \\n         \\n     \\n  \\n      \\n        \\n             \\n            \\n        \\n    \\n     \\n        \\n      \\n          \\n          \\n      \\n   \\n        \\n      \\n     \\n        \\n \\n    \\n           \\n          \\n         \\n            \\n             \\n       \\n  \\n  \\n          \\n        \\n          \\n     \\n   \\n  \\n        \\n           \\n       \\n       \\n      \\n  \\n        \\n          \\n        \\n          \\n             \\n       \\n             \\n            \\n       \\n            \\n            \\n       \\n        \\n      \\n          \\n I 15 \\n5.10 Dysphagia\\nEsophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Aspiration pneumonia is \\na common cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with advanced Alzheimer’s disease. Olanzapine is not approved for \\nthe treatment of patients with Alzheimer’s disease. \\n5.11 Seizures \\nDuring premarketing testing, seizures occurred in 0.9% (22/2500) of olanzapine -treated patients. There were \\nconfounding factors that may have contributed to the occurrence of seizures in many of these cases. Olanzapine should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold, e. g., \\nAlzheime r’s dementia. Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer’s disease. Conditions that \\nlower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in a population of 65 years or older. \\n5.12 Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment\\nSomnolence was a commonly reported adverse reaction associated with olanzapine treatment, occurring at an \\nincidence of 26% in olanzapine patients compared to 15% in placebo patients. This adverse reaction was also dose \\nrelated. Somnolence led to discontinuation in 0.4% (9/2500) of patients in the premarketing database. \\nSince olanzapine has the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about \\noperating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that olanzapine therapy does not \\naffect them advers ely [see Patient Counseling Information (17)] . \\n5.13 Body Temperature Regulation Disruption of the bod y’s ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. \\nAppropriate care is advised when prescribing olanzapine for patients who will be experiencing conditions which may \\ncontribute to an elevation in core body temperature, e. g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving \\nconcomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration [see Patient Counseling Information \\n(17)]. \\n5.14 Anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) Effects\\nOlanzapine exhibits in vitro muscarinic receptor affinity [see Clinical Pharmacology 12.2] . In premarketing clinical \\ntrials , Zyprexa was associated with constipation, dry mouth, and tachycardia, all adverse reactions possibly related to \\ncholinergic antagonism. Such adverse reactions were not often the basis for discontinuations, but Zyprexa should be used \\nwith caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic \\nhypertrophy, constipation, or a history of paralytic ileus or related conditions . In post marketing experience, the risk for \\nsevere adverse reactions (including fatalities) was increased with concomitant use of anticholinergic medications [see \\nDrug Interactions (7.1)] . \\n5.15 Hyperprolactinemia\\nAs with other drugs that antagonize dopamine D\\n2 receptors, olanzapine elevates prolactin levels, and the elevation \\npersists during chronic administration. Hyperprolactinemia may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced \\npituitary gonadotropin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in \\nboth female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactin- elevating compounds. Long- standing hyperprolactinemia when associated with hypogonadism may \\nlead to decreased bone density in both female and male subjects. \\nTissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one -third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent \\nin vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with previously \\ndetected breast cancer. As is common with compounds which increase prolactin release, an increase in mammary gland \\nneoplasia was observed in the olanzapine carcinogenicity studies conducted in mice and rats [see Nonclinical Toxicology \\n(13.1)] . Published epidemiologic studies have shown inconsistent results when exploring the potential association \\nbetween hyperprolactinemia and breast cancer. \\nIn placebo- controlled olanzapine clinical studies (up to 12 weeks), changes from normal to high in prolactin \\nconcentrations were observed in 30% of adults treated with olanzapine as compared to 10.5% of adults treated with \\nplacebo. In a pooled analysis from clinical studies including 8136 adults treated with olanzapine, potentially associated \\nclinical manifestations included menstrual -related events\\n1 (2% [49/3240] of females), sexual function- related events2 (2% \\n[150/8136] of females and males), and breast -related events3 (0.7% [23/3240] of females, 0.2% [9/4896] of males ). \\nIn placebo- controlled olanzapine monotherapy studies in adolescent patients (up to 6 weeks) with schizophrenia or \\nbipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes), changes from normal to high in prolactin concentrations were observed in \\n47% of olanzapine -treated patients compared to 7% of placebo- treated patients . In a pooled analysis from clinical trials \\nincluding 454 adolescents treated with olanzapine, poten tially associated clinical manifestations included menstrual -\\nrelated events1 (1% [2/168] of females), sexual function- related events2 (0.7% [3/454] of females and males), and breast -\\nrelated events3 (2% [3/168] of females, 2% [7/286] of males) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . \\n1 Based on a search of the following terms: amenorrhea, hypomenorrhea, menstruation delayed, and oligomenorrhea. \\n2 Based on a search of the following terms: anorgasmia, delayed ejaculation, erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, loss \\nof libido, abnormal orgasm , and sexual dysfunction. \\n3 Based on a search of the following terms: breast discharge, enlargement or swelling, galactorrhea, gynecomastia, and \\nlactation disorder. \\nReference ID: 5516073 \\n \\n     \\n            \\n       \\n              \\n       \\n     \\n     \\n         \\n           \\n  \\n   \\n       \\n     \\n  \\n      \\n   \\n    \\n      \\n              \\n   \\n    \\n         \\n         \\n         \\n      \\n            \\n            \\n        \\n            \\n                 \\n       \\n            \\n         \\n              \\n \\n     \\n       \\n          \\n              \\n        \\n           \\n            \\n           \\n \\n        \\n          \\n            \\n           \\n     \\n         \\n            \\n         \\n          \\n        \\n        \\n  \\n       \\n           \\n        16 \\nDose group differences with respect to prolactin elevation have been observed.

When using ZYPREXA in combination with lithium or valproate, \\nthe prescriber should refer to the Warnings and Precautions sections of the package inserts for lithiu m or valproate [see \\nDrug Interactions (7)] . \\n5.17 Laboratory Tests\\nFasting blood glucose testing and lipid profile at the beginning of , and periodically during, treatment is \\nrecommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5. 5) and Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. \\n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS When using ZYPREXA and fluoxetine in combination, also refer to the Adverse Reactions section of the package \\ninsert for Symbyax . \\n6.1 Clinical Trials ExperienceBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the \\nclinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect or \\npredict the rates observed in practice. \\nClinical Trials in Adults \\nThe information below for olanzapine is derived from a clinical trial database for olanzapine consisting of 10,504 \\nadult patients with approximately 4765 patient -years of exposure to olanzapine plus 722 patients with exposure to \\nintramuscular olanzapine for injection. This database includes: (1) 2500 patients who participated in multiple- dose oral \\nolanzapine premarketing trials in schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s disease representing approximately 1122 patient -years of \\nexposure as of February 14, 1995; (2) 182 patients who participated in oral olanzapine premarketing bipolar I disorder \\n(manic or mixed episodes) trials representing approximately 66 patient -years of exposure; (3) 191 patients who \\nparticipated in an oral olanzapine trial of patients having various psychiatric symptoms in association with Alzheimer’s \\ndisease representing approximately 29 patient -years of exposure; (4) 5788 additional patients from 88 oral olanzapine \\nclinical trials as of December 31, 2001; (5) 1843 additional patients from 41 olanzapine clinical trials as of October 31, \\n2011; and ( 6) 722 patients who participated in intramuscular olanzapine for injection premarketing trials in agitated \\npatients with schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes), or dementia. Also included below is information \\nfrom the premarketing 6 -week clinical study database for olanzapine in combination with lithium or valproate, consisting of \\n224 patients who participated in bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) trials with approximately 22 patient -years of \\nexposure. \\nThe conditions and duration of treatment with olanzapine varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) \\nopen -label and double- blind phases of studies, inpatients and outpatients, fixed -dose and dose- titration studies, and \\nshort -term or longer -term exposure. Adverse reactions were assessed by collecting adverse reactions , results of physical \\nexaminations, vital signs, weights, laboratory analytes, ECGs, chest x- rays, and results of ophthalmologic examinations. \\nCertain portions of the discussion below relating to objective or numeric safety parameters, namely, dose -\\ndependent adverse reactions , vital sign changes, weight gain, laboratory changes, and ECG changes are derived from \\nstudies in patients with schizophrenia and have not been duplicated for bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) or \\nagitation. However, this information is also generally applicable to bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) and \\nagitation. \\nAdverse reactions during exposure were obtained by spontaneous report and recorded by clinical investigators \\nusing terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the \\nproportion of individuals experiencing adverse reactions without first grouping similar types of reactions into a smaller \\nnumber of standardized reaction categories. In the tables and tabulations that follow, MedDRA and COSTART Dictionary \\nterminology has been used to classify reported adv erse reactions . \\nThe stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least \\nonce, a treatment -emergent adverse reaction of the type listed. A reaction was considered treatment emergent if it \\noccurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. The reported reactions do not \\ninclude those reaction terms that were so general as to be uninformative. Reactions listed elsewhere in labeling may not \\nbe repeated below. It is important to emphasize that, although the reactions occurred during treatment with olanzapine, \\nthey were not necessarily caused by it. The entire label should be read to gain a complete understanding of the safety profile of olanzapine. \\nThe prescriber should be aware that the figures in the tables and tabulations cannot be used to predict the \\nincidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from \\nReference ID: 5516073 \\n \\n          \\n     \\n  \\n     \\n           \\n          \\n      \\n     \\n     \\n      \\n          \\n        \\n            \\n         \\n        \\n      \\n      \\n               \\n         \\n           \\n        \\n          \\n    \\n        \\n         \\n    \\n      \\n     \\n    \\n  \\n   \\n    \\n   \\n    \\n   \\n    \\n   \\n        \\n      \\n       \\n    \\n  \\n   \\n   \\n    \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n         \\n         17 \\nother clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide \\nthe prescribing healthcare provider with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to \\nthe adverse reactions incidence in the population studied. \\nIncidence of Adverse Reactions in Short -Term, Placebo -Controlled and Combination Trials \\nThe following findings are based on premarketing trials of (1) oral olanzapine for s chizophrenia, bipolar I disorder \\n(manic or mixed episodes), a subsequent trial of patients having various psychiatric symptoms in association with Alzheime r’s disease, and premarketing combination trials, and (2) intramuscular olanzapine for injection in agitated \\npatients with schizophrenia or b ipolar I mania. \\nAdverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in Short -Term, Placebo -Controlled Trials \\nSchizophrenia — Overall, there was no difference in the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions (5% \\nfor oral olanzapine vs 6% for placebo). However, discontinuations due to increases in ALT were considered to be drug \\nrelated (2% for oral olanzapine vs 0% for placebo). \\nBipolar I Disorder (Manic or Mixed Episodes) Monotherapy — Overall, there was no difference in the incidence of \\ndiscontinuation due to adverse reactions (2% for oral olanzapine vs 2% for placebo). \\nAgitation — Overall, there was no difference in the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions (0.4% for \\nintramuscular olanzapine for injection vs 0% for placebo). \\nAdverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in Short -Term Combination Trials \\nBipolar I Disorder (Manic or Mixed Episodes) , Olanzapine as Adjunct to Lithium or Valproate — In a study of \\npatients who were already tolerating either lithium or valproate as monotherapy, discontinuation rates due to adverse reactions were 11% for the combination of oral olanzapine with lithium or valproate compared to 2% for patients who \\nremained on lithium or valproate monotherapy. Discontinuations with the combination of oral olanzapine and lithium or valproate that occurred in more than 1 patient were: somnolence (3%), weight gain (1%), and peripheral edema (1%). \\nCommonly Observed Adverse Reactions in Short -Term, Placebo -Controlled Trials \\nThe most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of oral olanzapine (incidence of 5% or \\ngreater) and not observed at an equivalent incidence among placebo- treated patients (olanzapine incidence at least twice \\nthat for placebo) were: \\nTable 9 : Common Treatment -Emergent Adv erse Reactions Associated with the\\nUse of Oral Olanzapine in 6- Week Trials — SCHIZOPHRENIA \\nPercentage of Patients Reporting Event \\nOlanzapine Placebo \\nAdverse Reaction (N=248) (N=118) \\nPostural hypotension 5 2 \\nConstipation 9 3 \\nWeight gain 6 1 \\nDizziness 11 4 \\nPersonality disordera 8 4 \\nAkathisia 5 1 \\na Personality disorder is the COSTART term for designating nonaggressive objectionable behavior. \\nTable 10: Common Treatment -Emergent Adverse Reactions Associated with the\\nUse of Oral Olanzapine in 3- Week and 4- Week Trials — Bipolar I Disorder (Manic or Mixed Episodes)\\nPercentage of Patients Reporting Event \\nOlanzapine Placebo \\nAdverse Reaction (N=125) (N=129) \\nAsthenia 15 6 \\nDry mouth 22 7 \\nConstipation 11 5 \\nDyspepsia 11 5 \\nIncreased appetite 6 3 \\nSomnolence 35 13 \\nDizziness 18 6 \\nTremor 6 3 \\nOlanzapine Intramuscular — There was 1 adverse reaction (somnolence) observed at an incidence of 5% or \\ngreater among intramuscular olanzapine for injection -treated patients and not observed at an equivalent incidence among \\nReference ID: 5516073 \\n  \\n       \\n         \\n           \\n \\n       \\n  \\n          \\n          \\n  \\n \\n    \\n        \\n     \\n   \\n   \\n      \\n    \\n   \\n   \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n    \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n    \\n   \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n    \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n    \\n   \\n    \\n    \\n     \\n \\n   18 \\nplacebo -treated patients (olanzapine incidence at least twice that for placebo) during the placebo- controlled premarketing \\nstudies.

Within the original premarketing database of about 2400 \\nadult patients with baseline ALT ≤90 IU/L, the incidence of ALT elevations to >200 IU/L was 2% (50/2381). None of these \\npatients experienced jaundice or other symptoms attributable to liver impairment and most had transient changes that \\ntended to normalize while olanzapine treatment was continued. \\nReference ID: 5516073 c \\n \\n        \\n             \\n           \\n          \\n           \\n           \\n  \\n         \\n        \\n       \\n     \\n  \\n     \\n         \\n         \\n        \\n       \\n           \\n          \\n                  \\n     \\n       \\n          \\n            \\n         \\n         \\n            \\n \\n            \\n       \\n         \\n        \\n          \\n       \\n   \\n        \\n            \\n   \\n         \\n           \\n          \\n       \\n           \\n        \\n          \\n \\n       \\n   \\n        \\n \\n       \\n     \\n  \\n          \\n      \\n          \\n            \\n       25 \\nIn placebo- controlled olanzapine monotherapy studies in adults, clinically significant ALT elevations (change from \\n<3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] at baseline to ≥3 times ULN) were observed in 5% (77/1426) of patients exposed \\nto olanzapine compared to 1% (10/1187) of patients exposed to placebo. ALT elevations ≥5 times ULN were observed in \\n2% (29/1438) of olanzapine- treated patients, compared to 0.3% (4/1196) of placebo-treated patients. ALT values returned \\nto normal, or were decreasing, at last follow -up in the majority of patients who either continued treatment with olanzapine \\nor discontinued olanzapine. No patient with elevated ALT values experienced jaundice, liver failure, or met the criteria for \\nHy’s Rule. \\nFrom an analysis of the laboratory data in an integrated database of 41 completed clinical studies in adult patients \\ntreated with oral olanzapine, high GGT levels were recorded in ≥1% (88/5245) of patients. \\nCaution should be exercised in patients with signs and symptoms of hepatic impairment, in patients with pre-\\nexisting conditions associated with limited hepatic functional reserve, and in patients who are being treated with potentiall y \\nhepatotoxic drugs. \\nOlanzapine administration was also associated with increases in serum prolactin [see Warnings and Precautions \\n(5.15 )], with an asymptomatic elevation of the eosinophil count in 0.3% of patients, and with an increase in CPK. \\nFrom an analysis of the laboratory data in an integrated database of 41 completed clinical studies in adult patients \\ntreated with oral olanzapine, elevated uric acid was recorded in ≥ 3% (171/4641) of patients. \\nOlanzapine Monotherapy in Adolescents: In placebo- controlled clinical trials of adolescent patients with \\nschizophrenia or bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes), greater frequencies for the following treatment -emergent \\nfindings, at anytime, were observed in laboratory analytes compared to placebo: elevated ALT (≥ 3X ULN in patients with \\nALT at baseline <3X ULN), (12% vs 2%); elevated AST (28% vs 4%); low total bilirubin (22% vs 7%); elevated GGT (10% \\nvs 1%); and elevated prolactin (47% vs 7%). \\nIn placebo- controlled olanzapine monotherapy studies in adolescents, clinically significant ALT elevations (change \\nfrom <3 times ULN at baseline to ≥3 times ULN) were observed in 12% (22/192) of patients exposed to olanzapine \\ncompared to 2% (2/109) of patients exposed to placebo. ALT elevations ≥5 times ULN were observed in 4% (8/192) of \\nolanzapine- treated patients, compared to 1% (1/109) of placebo- treated patients. ALT values returned to normal, or were \\ndecreasing, at last follow- up in the majority of patients who either continued treatment with olanzapine or discontinued \\nolanzapine. No adolescent patient with elevated ALT values experienced jaundice, liver failure, or met the criteria for Hy’s \\nRule. \\nECG Changes — In pooled studies of adults as well as pooled studies of adolescents, there were no significant \\ndifferences between olanzapine and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially important changes in ECG parameters, including QT, QTc (Fridericia corrected), and PR intervals. Olanzapine use was associated with a mean \\nincrease in heart rate compared to placebo (adults: +2.4 beats per minute vs no change with placebo; adolescents: +6.3 beats per minute vs -5.1 beats per minute with placebo). This increase in heart rate may be related to olanzapine’s \\npotential for inducing orthostatic changes [see Warnings and Precautions (5. 7)]. \\n6.2 Postmarketing ExperienceThe following adverse reactions have been identified during post -approval use of ZYPREXA. Because these \\nreactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is difficult to reliably estimate their frequency or \\nevaluate a causal relationship to drug exposure. \\nAdverse reactions reported since market introduction that were temporally (but not necessarily causally) related to \\nZYPREXA therapy include the following: allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylactoid reaction, angioedema, pruritus or urticaria), cholestatic or mixed liver injury, diabetic coma, diabetic ketoacidosis, discontinuation reaction (diaphoresis, nausea or \\nvomiting), Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), hepatitis, jaundice, neutropenia, \\npancreatitis, priapism, rash, restless legs syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, salivary hypersecretion, stuttering\\n1, venous \\nthromboembolic events (including pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis), fecal incontinence, and \\nsomnambulism. Random cholesterol levels of ≥240 mg/dL and random triglyceride levels of ≥1000 mg/dL have been \\nreported.\\n1 Stuttering was only studied in oral and long acting injection (LAI) formulations . \\n7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The risks of using olanzapine in combination with other drugs have not been extensively evaluated in systematic \\nstudies. \\n7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Olanzapine\\nDiazepam — The co -administration of diazepam with olanzapine potentiated the orthostatic hypotension observed \\nwith olanzapine [see Drug Interactions (7.2)] . \\nCimetidine and Antacids — Single doses of cimetidine (800 mg) or aluminum- and magnesium -containing antacids \\ndid not affect the oral bioavailability of olanzapine. \\nInducers of CYP1A2 — Carbamazepine therapy (200 mg bid) causes an approximately 50% increase in the \\nclearance of olanzapine. This increase is likely due to the fact that carbamazepine is a potent inducer of CYP1A2 activity. \\nHigher daily doses of carbamazepine may cause an even greater increase in olanzapine clearance. \\nReference ID: 5516073 \\n  \\n        \\n     \\n  \\n   \\n        \\n      \\n          \\n   \\n   \\n          \\n       \\n         \\n       \\n     \\n         \\n      \\n \\n            \\n              \\n   \\n         \\n      \\n        \\n     \\n         \\n    \\n          \\n  \\n     \\n            \\n            \\n         \\n    \\n            \\n        \\n \\n          \\n        \\n   \\n         \\n           \\n      \\n         \\n \\n        \\n \\n       \\n    \\n    \\n          \\n       \\n          \\n    \\n      \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n        \\n         26 \\nAlcohol — Ethanol (45 mg/70 kg single dose) did not have an effect on olanzapine pharmacokinetics. The co-\\nadministration of alcohol (i.e., ethanol) with olanzapine potentiated the orthostatic hypotension observed with olanzapine \\n[see Drug Interactions (7.2)] . \\nInhibitors of CYP1A2 \\nFluvoxamine: Fluvoxamine, a CYP1A2 inhibitor, decreases the clearance of olanzapine. This results in a mean \\nincrease in olanzapine Cmax following fluvoxamine of 54% in female nonsmokers and 77% in male smokers. The mean \\nincrease in olanzapine AUC is 52% and 108%, respectively. Lower doses of olanzapine should be considered in patients \\nreceiving concomitant treatment with fluvoxamine. \\nInhibitors of CYP2D6 \\nFluoxetine: Fluoxetine (60 mg single dose or 60 mg daily dose for 8 days) causes a small (mean 16%) increase in \\nthe maximum concentration of olanzapine and a small (mean 16%) decrease in olanzapine clearance. The magnitude of \\nthe impact of this factor is small in comparison to the overall variability between individuals, and therefore dose \\nmodification is not routinely recommended. When using ZYPREXA and fluoxetine in combination, also refer to the Drug Interactions section of the package insert for Symbyax. \\nWarfarin — Warfarin (20 mg single dose) did not affect olanzapine pharmacokinetics [see Drug Interactions (7.2)] . \\nInducers of CYP1A2 or Glucuronyl Transferase — Omeprazole and rifampin may cause an increase in olanzapine \\nclearance. \\nCharcoal — The administration of activated charcoal (1 g) reduced the Cmax and AUC of oral olanzapine by about \\n60%. As peak olanzapine levels are not typically obtained until about 6 hours after dosing, charcoal may be a useful treatment for olanzapine overdose. \\nAnticholinergic Drugs — Concomitant treatment with olanzapine and other drugs with anticholinergic activity can increase \\nthe risk for severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions related to hypomotility. ZYPREXA should be used with caution in \\npatients receiving medications having anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)] . \\n7.2 Potential for Olanzapine to Affect Other Drugs\\nCNS Acting Drugs — Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine, caution should be used when olanzapine is \\ntaken in combination with other centrally acting drugs and alcohol. \\nAntihypertensive Agents — Olanzapine, because of its potential for inducing hypotension, may enhance the effects \\nof certain antihypertensive agents. \\nLevodopa and Dopamine Agonists — Olanzapine may antagonize the effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists. \\nLorazepam (IM) — Administration of intramuscular lorazepam (2 mg) 1 hour after intramuscular olanzapine for \\ninjection (5 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine, unconjugated lorazepam, or total \\nlorazepam. However, this co- administration of intramuscular lorazepam and intramuscular olanzapine for injection added \\nto the somnolence observed with either drug alone [see Warnings and Precautions (5. 7)]. \\nLithium — Multiple doses of olanzapine (10 mg for 8 days) did not influence the kinetics of lithium. Therefore, \\nconcomitant olanzapine administration does not require dosage adjustment of lithium [see Warnings and Precautions \\n(5.16 )]. \\nValproate — Olanzapine (10 mg daily for 2 weeks) did not affect the steady state plasma concentrations of \\nvalproate. Therefore, concomitant olanzapine administration does not require dosage adjustment of valproate [see \\nWarnings and Precautions (5. 16)]. \\nEffect of Olanzapine on Drug Metabolizing Enzymes — In vitro studies utilizing human liver microsomes suggest \\nthat olanzapine has little potential to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A. Thus, olanzapine is unlikely to cause clinically important drug interactions mediated by these enzymes. \\nImipramine — Single doses of olanzapine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of imipramine or its active metabolite \\ndesipramine. \\nWarfarin — Single doses of olanzapine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin [see Drug Interactions \\n(7.1)]. \\nDiazepam — Olanzapine did not influence the pharmacokinetics of diazepam or its active metabolite N -\\ndesmethyldiazepam. However, diazepam co-administered with olanzapine increased the orthostatic hypotension \\nobserved with either drug given alone [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . \\nAlcohol — Multiple doses of olanzapine did not influence the kinetics of ethanol [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . \\nBiperiden — Multiple doses of olanzapine did not influence the kinetics of biperiden. \\nTheophylline — Multiple doses of olanzapine did not affect the pharm acokinetics of theophylline or its metabolites. \\nUSE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS When using ZYPREXA and fluoxetine in combination, also refer to the Use in Specific Populations section of the \\npackage insert for Symbyax . \\n8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry \\nThere is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to atypical \\nantipsychotic s, including ZYPREXA, during pregnancy.

Overall available data from \\npublished epidemiologic studies of pregnant women exposed to olanzapine have not established a drug -associated risk of \\nmajor birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data). There are risks to the mother \\nassociated with untreated schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder and with exposure to antipsychotics, including ZYPREXA, \\nduring pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). \\nOlanzapine was not teratogenic when administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses that are 9 -and \\n30-times the daily oral maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), based on mg/m2 body surface area; some fetal \\ntoxicities were observed at these doses (see Data ). \\nThe estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All \\npregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. I n the U .S. general population, the \\nestimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and \\n15% to 20% , respectively. \\nClinical Considerations \\nDisease -associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk \\nThere is a risk to the mother from untreated schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder, including increased risk of relapse, \\nhospitalization, and suicide. Schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder are associated with increased adverse perinatal outcomes, including preterm birth. It is not known if this is a direct result of the illness or other comorbid factors. \\nFetal/Neonatal adverse reactions \\nExtrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms , including agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, \\nrespiratory distress , and feeding disorder have been reported in neonates who were exposed to antipsychotic drugs, \\nincluding ZYPREXA, during the third trimester of pregnancy. These symptoms have varied in severity. Monitor neonates \\nfor extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms and manage symptoms appropriately. S ome neonates recovered within \\nhours or days without specific treatment; other s required prolonged hospitalization. \\nData \\nHuman Data \\nPlacental passage has been reported in published study reports; however, the placental passage ratio was highly variable \\nranging between 7 % to 167% at birth following exposure during pregnancy. The clinical relevance of this finding is \\nunknown. \\nPublished data from observational studies, birth registries, and case reports that have evaluated the use of atypical \\nantipsychotics during pregnancy do not establish an increased risk of major birth defects. A retrospective cohort study \\nfrom a Medicaid database of 9258 women exposed to antipsychotics during pregnancy did not indicate an overall increased risk for major birth defects. \\nAnimal Data \\nIn oral reproduction studies in rats at doses up to 18 mg/kg/day and in rabbits at doses up to 30 mg/kg/day (9 and \\n30 times the daily oral MRHD based on mg/m\\n2 body surface area, respectively), no evidence of teratogenicity was \\nobserved. In an oral rat teratology study, early resorptions and increased numbers of nonviable fetuses were observed at \\na dose of 18 mg/kg/day (9 times the daily oral MRHD based on mg/m2 body surface area ), and gestation was prolonged \\nat 10 mg/kg/day (5 times the daily oral MRHD based on mg/m2 body surface area ). In an oral rabbit teratology study, fetal \\ntoxicity manifested as increased resorptions and decreased fetal weight , occurred at a maternally toxic dose of \\n30 mg/kg/day (30 times the daily oral MRHD based on mg/m2 body surface area). \\n8.2 Lactation \\nRisk Summary \\nOlanzapine is present in human milk . There are reports of excess sedation, irritability, poor feeding and \\nextrapyramidal symptoms (tremors and abnormal muscle movements) in infants exposed to olanzapine through breast \\nmilk (see Clinical Considerations). There is no information on the effects of olanzapine on milk production. \\nThe developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical \\nneed for ZYPREXA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from ZYPREXA or from the mother’s \\nunderlying condition. \\nClinical Considerations \\nInfants exposed to ZYPREXA should be monitored for excess sedation, irritability, poor feeding, and \\nextrapyramidal symptoms (tremors and abnormal muscle movements). \\n8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential \\nInfertility \\nFemales \\nBased on the pharmacologic action of olanzapine (D 2 receptor antagonism), treatment with ZYPREXA may result \\nin an increase in serum prolactin levels, which may lead to a reversible reduction in fertility in females of reproductive \\npotential [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)] . \\nReference ID: 5516073 \\n  \\n   \\n           \\n          \\n        \\n          \\n           \\n        \\n        \\n       \\n         \\n        \\n           \\n  \\n       \\n \\n       \\n        \\n       \\n \\n  \\n              \\n         \\n         \\n       \\n     \\n         \\n        \\n       \\n        \\n          \\n          \\n        \\n       \\n        \\n           \\n         \\n       \\n       \\n          \\n       \\n     \\n  \\n     \\n            \\n              \\n   \\n            \\n           \\n            \\n         \\n           \\n      \\n  \\n   \\n         \\n          \\n       \\n      \\n         28 \\n8.4 Pediatric Use \\nThe safety and effectiveness of oral ZYPREXA in the treatment of schizophrenia and manic or mixed episodes \\nassociated with bipolar I disorder were established in short -term studies in adolescents (ages 13 to 17 years). Use of \\nZYPREXA in adolescents is supported by evidence from adequate and well -controlled studies of ZYPREXA in which 268 \\nadolescents received ZYPREXA in a range of 2.5 to 20 mg/day [see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2)] . Recommended starting \\ndose for adolescents is lower than that for adults [se e Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)] . Compared to patients from \\nadult clinical trials, adolescents were likely to gain more weight, experience increased sedation, and have greater increases in total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, prolactin and hepatic aminotransferase levels [see Warnings \\nand Precautions (5. 5, 5.15, 5.17) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1)]. When deciding among the alternative treatments \\navailable for adolescents, clinicians should consider the increased potential (in adolescents as compared with adults) for \\nweight gain and dyslipidemia. Clinicians should consider the potential long- term risks when prescribing to adolescents, \\nand in many cases this may lead them to consider prescribing other drugs first in adolescents [see Indications and Usage \\n(1.1, 1.2)] . \\nSafety and effectiveness of olanzapine in children <13 years of age have not been established [see Patient \\nCounseling Information (17)] . \\nSafety and eff icacy of ZYPREXA and fluoxetine in combination in children and adolescents (10 to 17 years of age ) \\nhave been established for the acute treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. \\nSafety and effectiveness of ZYPREXA and fluoxetine in combination in children <10 years of age have not been \\nestablished. \\n8.5 Geriatric Use \\nOf the 2500 patients in premarketing clinical studies with oral olanzapine, 11% (263) were 65 years of age or over. \\nIn patients with schizophrenia, there was no indication of any different tolerability of olanzapine in the elderly compared to \\nyounger patients. Studies in elderly patients with dementia- related psychosis have suggested that there may be a different \\ntolerability profile in this population compared to younger patients with schizophrenia. Elderly patients with dementia -\\nrelated psychosis treated with olanzapine are at an increased risk of death compared to placebo. In placebo- controlled \\nstudies of olanzapine in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis, there was a higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack) in patients treated with olanzapine compared to patients treated \\nwith placebo. In 5 placebo- controlled studies of olanzapine in elderly patients with dementia -related psychosis (n=1184), \\nthe following adverse reactions were reported in ola nzapine -treated patients at an incidence of at least 2% and \\nsignificantly greater than placebo- treated patients: falls, somnolence, peripheral edema, abnormal gait, urinary \\nincontinence, lethargy, increased weight, asthenia, pyrexia, pneumonia, dry mouth and visual hallucinations. The rate of \\ndiscontinuation due to adverse reactions was greater with olanzapine than placebo (13% vs 7%). Elderly patients with \\ndementia -related psychosis treated with olanzapine are at an increased risk of death compared to placebo. Olanzapine is \\nnot approved for the treatment of patients with dementia- related psychosis [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and \\nPrecautions (5.1), and Patient Counseling Information (17)] . Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with \\ndementia -related psychosis. Also, the presence of factors that might decrease pharmacokinetic clearance or increase the \\npharmacodynamic response to olanzapine should lead to consideration of a lower starting dose for any geriatric patient \\n[see Box ed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.1), and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . \\nClinical studies of ZYPREXA and fluoxetine in combination did not include sufficient numbers of patients ≥65 years \\nof age to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. \\n9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE \\n9.3 Dependence\\nIn studies prospectively designed to assess abuse and dependence potential, olanzapine was shown to have \\nacute depressive CNS effects but little or no potential of abuse or physical dependence in rats administered oral doses up to 15 times the daily oral MRHD (20 mg) and rhesus monkeys administered oral doses up to 8 times the daily oral MRHD \\nbased on mg/m\\n2 body surface area. \\nOlanzapine has not been systematically studied in humans for its potential for abuse, tolerance, or physical \\ndependence. While the clinical trials did not reveal any tendency for any drug- seeking behavior, these observations were \\nnot systematic, and it is not possible to predict on the basis of this limited experience the extent to which a CNS -active \\ndrug will be misused, diverted, and/or abused once marketed. Consequently, patients should be evaluated carefully for a history of drug abuse, and such patients should be observed closely for signs of misuse or abuse of olanzapine (e.g., \\ndevelopment of tolerance, increases in dose, drug -seeking behavior). \\n10 OVERDOSAGE \\n10.1 Human Experience\\nIn premarketing trials involving more than 3100 patients and/or normal subjects, accidental or intentional acute \\noverdosage of olanzapine was identified in 67 patients. In the patient taking the largest identified amount, 300 mg, the \\nonly symptoms reported were drowsiness and slurred speech. In the limited number of patients who were evaluated in \\nhospitals, including the patient taking 300 mg, there were no observations indicating an adverse change in laboratory \\nanalytes or ECG. Vital signs were usually within normal limits following overdoses. \\nReference ID: 5516073 \\n  \\n      \\n       \\n          \\n        \\n         \\n         \\n           \\n          \\n               \\n       \\n    \\n       \\n    \\n     \\n \\n          \\n  \\n          \\n      \\n     \\n  \\n         \\n     \\n        \\n \\n \\n      \\n     \\n               \\n              \\n         \\n           \\n              \\n        \\n             \\n            \\n         \\n           \\n        \\n          \\n         \\n  \\n   \\n    \\n            \\n        \\n  \\n           \\n              29 \\nIn postmarketing reports of overdose with olanzapine alone, symptoms have been reported in the majority of \\ncases. In symptomatic patients, symptoms with ≥10% incidence included agitation/aggressiveness, dysarthria, \\ntachycardia, various extrapyramidal symptoms, and reduced level of consciousness ranging from sedation to coma. \\nAmong less commonly reported symptoms were the following potentially medically serious reactions : aspiration, \\ncardiopulmonary arrest, cardiac arrhythmias (such as supraventricular tachycardia and 1 patient experiencing sinus pause \\nwith spontaneous resumption of normal rhythm), delirium, possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome, respiratory depression/arrest, convulsion, hypertension, and hypotension. Eli Lilly and Company has received reports of fatality in \\nassociation with overdose of olanzapine alone. In 1 case of death, the amount of acutely ingested olanzapine was \\nreported to be possibly as low as 450 mg of oral olanzapine; however, in another case, a patient was reported to survive \\nan acute olanzapine ingestion of approximately 2 g of oral olanzapine. \\n10.2 Management of Overdose\\nThere is no specific antidote to an overdose of ZYPREXA . The possibility of multiple drug involvement should be \\nconsidered. Establish and maintain an airway and ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Cardiovascular \\nmonitoring should commence immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias. \\nContact a Certified Poison Control Center for the most up to date information on the management of overdosage \\n(1-800-222-1222). \\nFor specific information about overdosage with lithium or valproate, refer to the Overdosage section of the \\nprescribing information for th ose products. For specific information about overdosage with olanzapine and fluoxetine in \\ncombination, refer to the Overdosage section of the Symbyax prescribing information. \\n11 DESCRIPTION \\nZYPREXA (olanzapine) is an atypical antipsychotic that belongs to the thienobenzodiazepine class.

Olanzapine binds with low affinity to GABA A, BZD, and β-adrenergic receptors (Ki>10 µM). \\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics \\nOral Administration, Monotherapy — Olanzapine is well absorbed and reaches peak concentrations in \\napproximately 6 hours following an oral dose. It is eliminated extensively by first pass metabolism, with approximately \\n40% of the dose metabolized before reaching the systemic circulation. Food does not affect the rate or extent of \\nolanzapine absorption. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that ZYPREXA tablets and ZYPREXA ZYDIS (olanzapine orally \\ndisintegrating tablets) dosage forms of olanzapine are bioequivalent. \\nOlanzapine displays linear kinetics over the clinical dosing range. Its half -life ranges from 21 to 54 hours (5th to \\n95th percentile; mean of 30 hr), and apparent plasma clearance ranges from 12 to 47 L/hr (5th to 95th percentile; mean of \\n25 L/hr). \\nAdministration of olanzapine once daily leads to steady -state concentrations in about 1 week that are \\napproximately twice the concentrations after single doses. Plasma concentrations, half -life, and clearance of olanzapine \\nmay vary between individuals on the basis of smoking status, gender, and age. \\nOlanzapine is extensively distributed throughout the body, with a volume of distribution of approximately 1000 L. It \\nis 93% bound to plasma proteins over the concentration range of 7 to 1100 ng/mL, binding primarily to albumin and \\nα1-acid glycoprotein. \\nMetabolism and Elimination — Following a single oral dose of 14C labeled olanzapine, 7% of the dose of \\nolanzapine was recovered in the urine as unchanged drug, indicating that olanzapine is highly metabolized. Approximately 57% and 30% of the dose was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. In the plasma, olanzapine accounted for \\nonly 12% of the AUC for total radioactivity, indicating significant exposure to metabolites. After multiple dosing, the major circulating metabolites were the 10 -N-glucuronide, present at steady state at 44% of the concentration of olanzapine, and \\n4´-N- desmethyl olanzapine, present at steady state at 31% of the concentration of olanzapine. Both metabolites lack \\npharmacological activity at the concentrations observed. \\nDirect glucuronidation and cytochrome P450 (CYP) mediated oxidation are the primary metabolic pathways for \\nolanzapine. In vitro studies suggest that CYPs 1A2 and 2D6, and the flavin -containing monooxygenase system are \\ninvolved in olanzapine oxidation. CYP2D6 mediated oxidation appears to be a minor metabolic pathway in vivo, because \\nthe clearance of olanzapine is not reduced in subjects who are deficient in this enzyme. \\nIntramuscular Administration — ZYPREXA IntraMuscular results in rapid absorption with peak plasma \\nconcentrations occurring within 15 to 45 minutes. Based upon a pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers, a 5 mg dose of intramuscular olanzapine for injection produces, on average, a maximum plasma concentration approximately 5 times \\nhigher than the maximum plasma concentration produced by a 5 mg dose of oral olanzapine. Area under the curve achieved after an intramuscular dose is similar to that achieved after oral administration of the same dose. The half -life \\nobserved after intramuscular administration is similar to that observed after oral dosing. The pharmacokinetics are linear \\nover the clinical dosing range. Metabolic profiles after intramuscular administration are qualitatively similar to metabolic \\nprofiles after oral administration. \\nSpecific Populations \\nRenal Impairment — Because olanzapine is highly metabolized before excretion and only 7% of the drug is \\nexcreted unchanged, renal dysfunction alone is unlikely to have a major impact on the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of olanzapine were similar in patients with severe renal impairment and normal \\nsubjects , indicating that dosage adjustment based upon the degree of renal impairment is not required. In addition, \\nolanzapine is not removed by dialysis. The effect of renal impairment on metabolite elimination has not been studied. \\nHepatic Impairment — Although the presence of hepatic impairment may be expected to reduce the clearance of \\nolanzapine, a study of the effect of impaired liver function in subjects (n=6) with clinically significant (Childs Pugh \\nClassification A and B) cirrhosis revealed little effect on the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine. \\nGeriatric — In a study involving 24 healthy subjects, the mean elimination half -life of olanzapine was about 1.5 \\ntimes greater in elderly ( ≥65 years) than in nonelderly subjects (< 65 years). Caution should be used in dosing the elderly, \\nespecially if there are other factors that might additively influence drug metabolism and/or pharmacodynamic sensitivity \\n[see Dosage and Administration (2)] . \\nGender — Clearance of olanzapine is approximately 30% lower in women than in men. There were, however, no \\napparent differences between men and women in effectiveness or adverse effects. Dosage modifications based on \\ngender should not be needed. \\nSmoking Status — Olanzapine clearance is about 40% higher in smokers than in nonsmokers, although dosage \\nmodifications are not routinely recommended. \\nRace — In vivo studies have shown that exposures are similar among Japanese, Chinese and Caucasians, \\nespecially after normalization for body weight differences. Dosage modifications for race are, therefore, not \\nrecommended. \\nCombined Effects — The combined effects of age, smoking, and gender could lead to substantial pharmacokinetic \\ndifferences in populations. The clearance in young smoking males, for example, may be 3 times higher than that in elderly nonsmoking females. Dosing modification may be necessary in patients who exhibit a combination of factors that may \\nresult in slower metabolism of olanzapine [see Dosage and Administration (2)] . \\nReference ID: 5516073 \\n  \\n          \\n       \\n   \\n      \\n      \\n                    \\n                \\n                   \\n           \\n        \\n            \\n               \\n           \\n        \\n             \\n      \\n        \\n        \\n           \\n      \\n     \\n         \\n          \\n          \\n    \\n        \\n              \\n          \\n      \\n              \\n            \\n   \\n    \\n        \\n            \\n          \\n     \\n           \\n            \\n            \\n               \\n          \\n         \\n \\n   \\n       \\n   \\n  \\n \\n         \\n               \\n               \\n    \\n        \\n           \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n            31 \\nAdolescents (ages 13 to 17 years) — In clinical studies, most adolescents were nonsmokers and this population \\nhad a lower average body weight, which resulted in higher average olanzapine exposure compared to adults. \\n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY \\n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\\nCarcinogenesis — Oral carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats. Olanzapine was administered to \\nmice in two 78 -week studies at doses of 3, 10, 30/20 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 0.8-5 times the daily oral MRHD based on \\nmg/m2 body surface area) and 0.25, 2, 8 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 0.06-2 times the daily oral MRHD based on mg/m2 \\nbody surface area). Rats were dosed for 2 years at doses of 0.25, 1, 2.5, 4 mg/kg/day (males) and 0.25, 1, 4, 8 mg/kg/day \\n(females) (equivalent to 0.13- 2 and 0.13- 4 times the daily oral MRHD based on mg/m2 body surface area, respectively). \\nThe incidence of liver hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas was significantly increased in 1 mouse study in female mice at 2 times the daily oral MRHD based on mg/m\\n2 body surface area. These tumors were not increased in another mouse \\nstudy in females dosed up to 2-5 times the daily oral MRHD based on mg/m2 body surface area; in this study, there wa s a \\nhigh incidence of early mortalities in males of the 30/20 mg/kg/day group. The incidence of mammary gland adenomas and adenocarcinomas was significantly increased in female mice dosed at ≥2 mg/kg/day and in female rats dosed at \\n≥4 mg/kg/day (0.5 and 2 times the daily oral MRHD based on mg/m\\n2 body surface area, respectively). Antipsychotic drugs \\nhave been shown to chronically elevate prolactin levels in rodents. Serum prolactin levels were not measured during the olanzapine carcinogenicity studies; however, measurements during subchronic toxicity studies showed that olanzapine \\nelevated serum prolactin levels up to 4- fold in rats at the same doses used in the carcinogenicity study. An increase in \\nmammary gland neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of other antipsychotic drugs and is \\nconsidered to be prolactin mediated. The relevance for human risk of the finding of prolactin mediated endocrine tumors in \\nrodents is unknown [see Warnings and Precautions (5. 15)]. \\nMutagenesis — No evidence of genotoxic potential for olanzapine was found in the Ames reverse mutation test, \\nin vivo micronucleus test in mice, the chromosomal aberration test in Chinese hamster ovary cells, unscheduled DNA \\nsynthesis test in rat hepatocytes, induction of forward mutation test in mouse lymphoma cells, or in vivo sister chromatid \\nexchange test in bone marrow of Chinese hamsters. \\nImpairment of Fertility — In an oral fertility and reproductive performance study in rats, male mating performance, \\nbut not fertility, was impaired at a dose of 22.4 mg/kg/day and female fertility was decreased at a dose of 3 mg/kg/day (11 \\nand 1.5 times the daily oral MRHD based on mg/m\\n2 body surface area, respectively). Discontinuance of olanzapine \\ntreatment reversed the effects on male mating performance. In female rats, the precoital period was increased and the \\nmating index reduced at 5 mg/kg/day (2.5 times the daily oral MRHD based on mg/m2 body surface area). Diestrous was \\nprolonged and estrous delayed at 1.1 mg/kg/day (0.6 times the daily oral MRHD based on mg/m2 body surface area ); \\ntherefore olanzapine may produce a delay in ovulation. \\n13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology\\nIn animal studies with olanzapine, the principal hematologic findings were reversible peripheral cytopenias in \\nindividual dogs dosed at 10 mg/kg (17 times the daily oral MRHD based on mg/m2 body surface area ), dose -related \\ndecreases in lymphocytes and neutrophils in mice, and lymphopenia in rats. A few dogs treated with 10 mg/kg developed reversible neutropenia and/or reversible hemolytic anemia between 1 and 10 months of treatment. Dose- related \\ndecreases in lymphocytes and neutrophils were seen in mice given doses of 10 mg/kg (equal to 2 times the daily oral \\nMRHD based on mg/m\\n2 body surface area) in studies of 3 months’ duration. Nonspecific lymphopenia, consistent with \\ndecreased body weight gain, occurred in rats receiving 22.5 mg/kg (11 times the daily oral MRHD based on mg/m2 body \\nsurface area ) for 3 months or 16 mg/kg (8 times the daily oral MRHD based on mg/m2 body surface area) for 6 or 12 \\nmonths. No evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found in any of the species examined. Bone marrows were normoc ellular or hypercellular, indicating that the reductions in circulating blood cells were probably due to peripheral \\n(non-marrow) factors. \\n14 CLINICAL STUDIES When using ZYPREXA and fluoxetine in combination, also refer to the Clinical Studies section of the package \\ninsert for Symbyax . \\n14.1 Schizophrenia \\nAdults \\nThe efficacy of oral olanzapine in the treatment of schizophrenia was established in 2 short -term (6 -week) \\ncontrolled trials of adult inpatients who met DSM III-R criteria for schizophrenia. A single haloperidol arm was included as \\na comparative treatment in 1 of the 2 trials, but this trial did not compare these 2 drugs on the full range of clinically \\nrelevant doses for both. \\nSeveral instruments were used for assessing psychiatric signs and symptoms in these studies, among them the \\nBrief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), a multi- item inventory of general psychopathology traditionally used to evaluate the \\neffects of drug treatment in schizophrenia. The BPRS psychosis cluster (conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory \\nbehavior, suspiciousness, and unusual thought content) is considered a particularly useful subset for assessing actively \\npsychotic schizophrenic patients. A second traditional assessment, the Clinical Global Impression (CGI), reflects the \\nimpression of a skilled observer, fully familiar with the manifestations of schizophrenia, about the overall clinical state of \\nReference ID: 5516073 \\n  \\n        \\n            \\n            \\n             \\n            \\n              \\n         \\n           \\n               \\n             \\n         \\n   \\n          \\n      \\n           \\n           \\n        \\n          \\n        \\n   \\n           \\n \\n \\n \\n         \\n        \\n       \\n      \\n         \\n        \\n           \\n        \\n        \\n \\n         \\n       \\n         \\n        \\n    \\n    \\n \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n   \\n       \\n         \\n        \\n           \\n           \\n   \\n         \\n            \\n        \\n        \\n        \\n           \\n             \\n            \\n             \\n          32 \\nthe patient. In addition, 2 more recently developed scales were employed; these included the 30- item Positive and \\nNegative Symptoms Scale (PANSS), in which are embedded the 18 items of the BPRS, and the Scale for Assessing \\nNegative Symptoms (SANS). The trial summaries below focus on the following outcomes: PANSS total and/or BPRS \\ntotal; BPRS psychosis cluster; PANSS negative subscale or SANS; and CGI Severity. The results of the trials follow: \\n(1) In a 6 -week, placebo -controlled trial (n=149) involving 2 fixed olanzapine doses of 1 and 10 mg/day (once daily \\nschedule), olanzapine, at 10 mg/day (but not at 1 mg/day), was superior to placebo on the PANSS total score (also on the \\nextracted BPRS total), on the BPRS psychosis cluster, on the PANSS Negative subscale, and on CGI Severity. \\n(2) In a 6 -week, placebo -controlled trial (n=253) involving 3 fixed dose ranges of olanzapine (5 ± 2.5 mg/day, \\n10 ± 2.5 mg/day, and 15 ± 2.5 mg/day) on a once daily schedule, the 2 highest olanzapine dose groups (actual mean \\ndoses of 12 and 16 mg/day, respectively) were superior to placebo on BPRS total score, BPRS psychosis cluster, and \\nCGI severity score; the highest olanzapine dose group was superior to placebo on the SANS. There was no clear \\nadvantage for the high-dose group over the medium -dose group. \\n(3) In a longer -term trial, adult outpatients (n=326) who predominantly met DSM -IV criteria for schizophrenia and \\nwho remained stable on olanzapine during open-label treatment for at least 8 weeks were randomized to continuation on \\ntheir current olanzapine doses (ranging from 10 to 20 mg/day) or to placebo. The follow -up period to observe patients for \\nrelapse, defined in terms of increases in BPRS positive symptoms or hospitalization, was planned for 12 months, \\nhowever, criteria were met for stopping the trial early due to an excess of placebo relapses compared to olanzapine \\nrelapses, and olanzapine was superior to placebo on time to relapse, the primary outcome for this study. Thus, olanzapine \\nwas more effective than placebo at maintaining efficacy in patients stabilized for approximately 8 weeks and followed for an observation period of up to 8 months. \\nExamination of population subsets (race and gender) did not reveal any differential responsiveness on the basis of \\nthese subgroupings. \\nAdolescents \\nThe efficacy of oral olanzapine in the acute treatment of schizophrenia in adolescents (ages 13 to 17 years) was \\nestablished in a 6- week double -blind, placebo- controlled, randomized trial of inpatients and outpatients with \\nschizophrenia (n=107) who met diagnostic criteria according to DSM -IV-TR and confirmed by the Kiddie Schedule for \\nAffective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Aged Children- Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS- PL). \\nThe primary rating instrument used for assessing psychiatric signs and symptoms in this trial was the Anchored \\nVersion of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale for Children (BPRS -C) total score. \\nIn this flexible -dose trial, olanzapine 2.5 to 20 mg/day (mean modal dose 12.5 mg/day, mean dose of 11.1 mg/day) \\nwas more effective than placebo in the treatment of adolescents diagnosed with schizophrenia, as supported by the \\nstatistically significantly g reater mean reduction in BPRS -C total score for patients in the olanzapine treatment group than \\nin the placebo group. \\nWhile there is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the adolescent patient treated with \\nZYPREXA should be maintained, maintenance efficacy can be extrapolated from adult data along with comparisons of olanzapine pharmacokinetic parameters in adult and adolescent patients. It is generally recommended that responding \\npatients be continued beyond the acute response, but at the lowest dose needed to maintain remission. Patients should \\nbe periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment. \\n14.2 Bipolar I Disorder (Manic or Mixed Episodes) \\nAdults \\nMonotherapy — The efficacy of oral olanzapine in the treatment of manic or mixed episodes was established in 2 \\nshort -term (one 3-week and one 4-week) placebo -controlled trials in adult patients who met the DSM -IV criteria for \\nbipolar I disorder with manic or mixed episodes. These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with \\nor without a rapid- cycling course. \\nThe primary rating instrument used for assessing manic symptoms in these trials was the Young Mania Rating \\nScale (Y -MRS), an 11- item clinician -rated scale traditionally used to assess the degree of manic symptomatology \\n(irritability, disruptive/aggressive behavior, sleep, elevated mood, speech, increased activity, sexual interest, language/thought disorder, thought content, appearance, and insight) in a range from 0 (no manic features) to 60 \\n(maximum score). The primary outcome in these trials was change from baseline in the Y -MRS total score. The results of \\nthe trials follow: \\n(1) In one 3-week placebo- controlled trial (n=67) which involved a dose range of olanzapine (5-20 mg/day, once \\ndaily, starting at 10 mg/day), olanzapine was superior to placebo in the reduction of Y -MRS total score. In an identically \\ndesigned trial conducted simultaneously with the first trial, olanzapine demonstrated a similar treatment difference, but \\npossibly due to sample size and site variability, was not shown to be superior to placebo on this outcome. \\n(2) In a 4 -week placebo -controlled trial (n=115) which involved a dose range of olanzapine (5-20 mg/day, once \\ndaily, starting at 15 mg/day), olanzapine was superior to placebo in the reduction of Y -MRS total score. \\n(3) In another trial, 361 patients meeting DSM -IV criteria for a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder who \\nhad responded during an initial open-label treatment phase for about 2 weeks, on average, to olanzapine 5 to 20 mg/day \\nwere randomized to either continuation of olanzapine at their same dose (n=225) or to placebo (n=136), for observation of relapse. Approximately 50% of the patients had discontinued from the olanzapine group by day 59 and 50% of the \\nReference ID: 5516073 \\n  \\n       \\n          \\n             \\n     \\n          \\n             \\n             \\n       \\n         \\n        \\n           \\n              \\n         \\n        \\n        \\n           \\n              \\n         \\n \\n \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n           \\n \\n         \\n     \\n           \\n         \\n           \\n  \\n         \\n       \\n         \\n        \\n    \\n    \\n           \\n            \\n            \\n         \\n           \\n          \\n         \\n            \\n        \\n             \\n         \\n        \\n            \\n           \\n       \\n        \\n             \\n            \\n            \\n    \\n         \\n         \\n       33 \\nplacebo group had discontinued by day 23 of double- blind treatment. Response during the open- label phase was defined \\nby having a decrease of the Y -MRS total score to ≤12 and HAM -D 21 to ≤8. Relapse during the double- blind phase was \\ndefined as an increase of the Y -MRS or HAM -D 21 total score to ≥15, or being hospitalized for either mania or depression. \\nIn the randomized phase, patients receiving continued olanzapine experienced a significantly longer time to relapse. \\nAdjunct to Lithium or Valproate — The efficacy of oral olanzapine with concomitant lithium or valproate in the \\ntreatment of manic or mixed episodes was established in 2 controlled trials in patients who met the DSM -IV criteria for \\nbipolar I disorder with manic or mixed episodes. These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with \\nor without a rapid- cycling course. The results of the trials follow: \\n(1) In one 6-week placebo- controlled combination trial, 175 outpatients on lithium or valproate therapy with \\ninadequately controlled manic or mixed symptoms (Y -MRS ≥16) were randomized to receive either olanzapine or placebo, \\nin combination with their original therapy. Olanzapine (in a dose range of 5- 20 mg/day, once daily, starting at 10 mg/day) \\ncombined with lithium or valproate (in a therapeutic range of 0.6 mEq/L to 1.2 mEq/L or 50 µg/mL to 125 µg/mL, \\nrespectively) was superior to lithium or valproate alone in the reduction of Y -MRS total score. \\n(2) In a second 6-week placebo -controlled combination trial, 169 outpatients on lithium or valproate therapy with \\ninadequately controlled manic or mixed symptoms (Y -MRS ≥16) were randomized to receive either olanzapine or placebo, \\nin combination with their original therapy. Olanzapine (in a dose range of 5- 20 mg/day, once daily, starting at 10 mg/day) \\ncombined with lithium or valproate (in a therapeutic range of 0.6 mEq/L to 1.2 mEq/L or 50 µg/mL to 125 µg/mL, \\nrespectively) was superior to lithium or valproate alone in the reduction of Y -MRS total score. \\nAdolescents \\nAcute Monotherapy — The efficacy of oral olanzapine in the treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes in \\nadolescents (ages 13 to 17 years) was established in a 3-week, double- blind, placebo- controlled, randomized trial of \\nadolescent inpatients and outpatients who met the diagnostic criteria for manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar \\nI disorder (with or without psychotic features) according to the DSM -IV-TR (n=161). Diagnosis was confirmed by the \\nK-SADS- PL. \\nThe primary rating instrument used for assessing manic symptoms in this trial was the Adolescent Structured \\nYoung -Mania Rating Scale (Y-MRS) total score. \\nIn this flexible -dose trial, olanzapine 2.5 to 20 mg/day (mean modal dose 10.7 mg/day, mean dose of 8.9 mg/day) \\nwas more effective than placebo in the treatment of adolescents with manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I \\ndisorder, as supported by the statistically significantly greater mean reduction in Y -MRS total score for patients in the \\nolanzapine treatment group than in the placebo group. \\nWhile there is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the adolescent patient treated with \\nZYPREXA should be maintained, maintenance efficacy can be extrapolated from adult data along with comparisons of \\nolanzapine pharmacokinetic parameters in adult and adolescent patients. It is generally recommended that responding \\npatients be continued beyond the acute response, but at the lowest dose needed to maintain remission. Patients should \\nbe periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment. \\n14.3 Agitation Associated with Schizophrenia and Bipolar I Mania\\nThe efficacy of intramuscular olanzapine for injection for the treatment of agitation was established in 3 short -term \\n(24 hours of IM treatment) placebo -controlled trials in agitated adult inpatients from 2 diagnostic groups: schizophrenia \\nand bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes). Each of the trials included a single active comparator treatment arm of \\neither haloperidol injection ( schizophrenia studies) or lorazepam injection ( bipolar I mania study). Patients enrolled in the \\ntrials needed to be: (1) judged by the clinical investigators as clinically agitated and clinically appropriate candidates for \\ntreatment with intramuscular medication, and (2) exhibiting a level of agitation that met or exceeded a threshold score of \\n≥14 on the 5 items comprising the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Excited Component (i.e., poor \\nimpulse control, tension, hostility, uncooperativeness and excitement items) with at least 1 individual item score ≥4 using \\na 1-7 scoring system (1=absent, 4=moderate, 7=extreme). In the studies, the mean baseline PANSS Excited Component \\nscore was 18.4, with scores ranging from 13 to 32 (out of a maximum score of 35), thus suggesting predominantly \\nmoderate levels of agitation with some patients experiencing mild or severe levels of agitation. The primary efficacy measure used for assessing agitation signs and symptoms in these trials was the change from baseline in the PANSS \\nExcited Component at 2 hours post -injection. Patients could receive up to 3 injections during the 24 hour IM treatment \\nperiods; however, patients could not receive the second injection until after the initial 2 hour period when the primary \\nefficacy measure was assessed. The results of the trials follow: \\n(1) In a placebo- controlled trial in agitated inpatients meeting DSM -IV criteria for schizophrenia (n=270), 4 fixed \\nintramuscular olanzapine for injection doses of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg and 10 mg were evaluated. All doses were \\nstatistically superior to placebo on the PANSS Excited Component at 2 hours post -injection. However, the effect was \\nlarger and more consistent for the 3 highest doses. There were no significant pairwise differences for the 7.5 and 10 mg \\ndoses over the 5 mg dose. \\n(2) In a second placebo -controlled trial in agitated inpatients meeting DSM -IV criteria for schizophrenia (n=311), 1 \\nfixed intramuscular olanzapine for injection dose of 10 mg was evaluated. Olanzapine for injection was statistically \\nsuperior to placebo on the PANSS Excited Component at 2 hours post -injection. \\nReference ID: 5516073 \\n  \\n         \\n          \\n           \\n     \\n          \\n   \\n    \\n  \\n            \\n           \\n        \\n \\n   \\n        \\n        \\n       \\n       \\n        \\n              \\n       \\n \\n       \\n     \\n \\n   \\n      \\n      \\n     \\n      \\n \\n         \\n \\n    \\n      \\n \\n    \\n \\n      \\n \\n   \\n        \\n              \\n              \\n       \\n              \\n          \\n        \\n            \\n   \\n    \\n        \\n \\n         \\n            \\n        \\n       \\n        \\n  34 \\n(3) In a placebo- controlled trial in agitated inpatients meeting DSM -IV criteria for bipolar I disorder (and currently \\ndisplaying an acute manic or mixed episode with or without psychotic features) (n=201), 1 fixed intramuscular olanzapine \\nfor injection dose of 10 mg was evaluated.

Talk with your doctor or pharmacist if there is \\nsomething you do not understand or you want to learn more about ZYPREXA. \\nWhat is the most important information I should know about ZYPREXA ? \\nZYPREXA may cause serious side effects , including: \\n1. Increased risk of death in elderly people who are confused, have memory loss and have lost touch with reality (dementia -related psychosis). \\n2. High blood sugar (hyperglycemia). \\n3. High fat levels in your blood (increased cholesterol and triglycerides), especially in teenagers age 13 to 17 or when used in combination with fluoxetine in children age 10 to \\n17. \\n4. Weight gain, especially in teenagers age 13 to 17 or when used in combination with \\nfluoxetine in children age 10 to 17 . \\nThese serious side effects are described below. \\n1. Increased risk of death in elderly people who are confused, have memory loss and have \\nlost touch with reality ( dementia -related psychosis). ZYPREXA is not approved for treating \\npsychosis in elderly people with dementia. 2. High blood sugar (hyperglycemia). High blood sugar can happen if you have diabetes already \\nor if you have never had diabetes. High blood sugar could lead to: \\n• a build up of acid in your blood due to ketones (ketoacidosis ) \\n• coma \\n• death \\nYour doctor should do tests to check your blood sugar before you start taking ZYPREXA and during \\ntreatment . In people who do not have diabetes, sometimes high blood sugar goes away when \\nZYPREXA is stopped. People with diabetes and some people who did not have diabetes before \\ntaking ZYPREXA need to take medicine for high blood sugar even after they stop taking ZYPREXA. \\nIf you have diabetes, follow your doctor’ s instructions about how often to check your blood sugar \\nwhile taking ZYPREXA . \\nCall you r doctor if you have any of these symptoms of high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) while \\ntaking ZYPREXA : \\n• feel very thirsty \\n• need to ur inate more than usual \\nReference ID: 4595907Reference ID: 5516073 \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n     \\n    \\n \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n     \\n   \\n       \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n \\n  \\n   \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n    2 \\n• feel very hungry \\n• feel weak or tired \\n• feel sick to your stomach \\n• feel confused or your breath smells fruity \\n3. High fat levels in your blood (cholesterol and triglyceride s). High fat levels may happen in \\npeople treated with ZYPREXA, especially in teenagers (13 to 17 years old), or when used in \\ncombination with fluoxetine in children (10 to 17 years old). You may not have any symptoms, so your \\ndoctor should do blood tests to check your cholesterol and triglyceride levels before you start taking \\nZYPREXA and during treatment. \\n4. Weight gain . Weight gain is very common in people who take ZYPREXA. Teenagers (13 to 17 \\nyears old) are more likely to gain weight and to gain more weight than adults. Children (10 to 17 years\\nold) are also more likely to gain weight and to gain more weight than adults when ZYPREXA is used \\nin combination with fluoxetine. Some people may gain a lot of weight while taking ZYPREXA, so you and your doctor should check your weight regularly. Talk to your doctor about ways to control weight gain, such as eating a healthy, balanced diet, and exercising. \\nWhat is ZYPREXA ? \\nZYPREXA is a prescription medicine used to treat: \\n• schizophrenia in people age 13 or older . \\n• bipolar disorder, including: \\n• manic or mixed episodes that happen with bipolar I disorder in people age 13 or older. \\n• manic or mixed episodes that happen with bipolar I disorder, when used with the medicine \\nlithium or valproate, in adults. \\n• long-term treatment of bipolar I disorder in adults. \\n• episodes of depression that happen wi th bipolar I disorder , when used with the medicine \\nfluoxetine (Prozac\\n®) in people age 10 or older . \\n• episodes of depression that do n ot get better after 2 other medicines, also called treatment \\nresistant depression, when used with the medicine fluoxetine (Prozac) , in adults . \\nZYPREXA has not been approved for use in children under 13 years of age. ZYPREXA in \\ncombination with fluoxetine has not been approved for use in children under 10 years of age. \\nThe symptoms of schizophrenia include hearing voices, seeing things that are not there, having \\nbeliefs that are not true, and being suspicious or withdrawn. \\nThe symptoms of bipolar I disorder include alternating periods of depression and high or irritable \\nmood, increased activity and restlessness, racing thoughts, talking fast, impulsive behavior, and a \\ndecreased need for sleep. \\nThe symptoms of treatment resistant depression include decreased mood, decreased interest, \\nincreased guilty feelings, decreased energy, decreased concentration, changes in appetite, and suicidal thoughts or behavior. \\nSome of your symptoms may improve with treatment. If you do not think you are getting better, call \\nyour doctor. \\nWhat should I tell my doctor before taking ZYPREXA ? \\nZYPREXA may not be right for you.

It is not known if ZYPREXA will harm your unborn \\nbaby . \\no If you become pregnant while receiving ZYPREXA , talk to your healthcare provider about \\nregistering with the National Pregnancy Registry for Atypical Antipsychotics. You can register by calling 1- 866-961-2388 or go to http://womensmentalhealth.org/clinical -and-\\nresearch- programs/pregnancyregistry/ . \\n• are breast -feeding or plan to breast -feed. ZYPREXA passes into your breast milk. Talk to your \\ndoctor about the best way to feed your baby if you take ZYPREXA . \\nTell your doctor if you exercise a lot or are in hot places often. \\nThe symptoms of bipolar I disorder , treatment resistant depression, or schizophrenia may include\\nthoughts of suicide or of hurting yourself or others. If you have these thoughts at any time , tell your \\ndoctor or go to an emergency room right away . \\nTell your doctor about all the medicines that you take , including prescripti on and nonprescription \\nmedicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. ZYPREXA and some medicines may interact with each \\nother and may not work as well, or cause possible serious side effects. Your doctor can tell you if it is \\nsafe to take ZYPREXA with your other medicines. Do not start or stop any medicine while taking \\nZYPREXA without talking to your doctor first. \\nHow should I take ZYPREXA ? \\n• Take ZYPREXA exactly as prescribed. Your doctor may need to change ( adjust ) the dose of \\nZYPREXA until it is right for you. \\n• If you miss a dose of ZYPREXA, take the missed dose as soon as you remember . If it is \\nalmost time for the next dose, just skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the regular \\ntime. Do not take two doses of ZYPREXA at the same time. \\n• To prevent serious side effects, do not stop taking ZYPREXA suddenly. If you need to \\nstop taking ZYPREXA , your doctor can tell you how to safely stop taking it. \\n• If you take too much ZYPREXA, call your doctor or poison control center at 1-800-222-\\n1222 right a way, or get emergency treatment. \\n• ZYPREXA can be taken with or without food. \\n• ZYPREXA is usually taken one time each day. \\n• Take ZYPREXA ZYDIS as follows: \\nReference ID: 5516073 \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n    \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n     \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n     \\n    \\n  \\n    \\n \\n \\n   \\n        \\n  \\n      \\n     \\n \\n    \\n   \\n \\n  \\n     \\n   4 \\n• Be sure that your hands are dry. \\n• Open the sachet and peel back the foil on the blister. Do not push the tablet through the \\nfoil. \\n• As soon as you open the blister, remove the tablet and put it into your mouth. \\n• The tablet will disintegrate quickly in your saliva so that you can easily swallow it with or without drinking liquid. \\n• Call your doct or if you do not think you are getting better or have any concerns about your\\ncondition while taking ZYPREXA . \\nWhat should I avoid while taking ZYPREXA ? \\n• ZYPREXA can cause sleepiness and may affect your ability to make decisions , think clearly , or \\nreact quickly . You should not drive, operate heavy machinery,  or do other dangerous activities \\nuntil you know how ZYPREXA affects you. \\n• Avoid drinking alcohol while taking ZYPREXA. Drinking alcohol while you take ZYPREXA may \\nmake you sleepier than if you take ZYPREXA alone. \\nWhat are the possible side effects of ZYPREXA? \\nSerious side effects may happen when you take ZYPREXA , including: \\n• See “What is the most important information I should know about ZYPREXA?” , which \\ndescribes the increased risk of death in elderly people with dementia -related psychosis \\nand the risks of high blood sugar, high cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and weight gain. \\n• Increased incidence of stroke or “mini -strokes” called transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) \\nin elderly people with dementia- related psychosis (elderly people who have lost touch with \\nreality due to confusion and memory loss ). ZYPREXA is not approved for these patients. \\n• Neuroleptic Malignant S yndrome (NMS) : NMS is a rare but very serious condition that can \\nhappen in people who take antipsychotic medicines, including ZYPREXA . NMS can cause \\ndeath and must be treated in a hospital. Call your doctor right away if you become severely ill \\nand have any of these symptoms: \\n• high fever \\n• excessive sweating \\n• rigid muscles \\n• confusion \\n• changes in your breathing, heartbeat, and blood pressure. \\n• Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) : DRESS can occur \\nwith ZYPREXA . Features of DRESS may include rash, fever , swollen glands and other internal \\norgan involvement such as liver, kidney, lung and heart .
